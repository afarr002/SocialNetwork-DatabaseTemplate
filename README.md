## Description

I built this project as a template for a full backend for a social media application. Testing the routes in Insomnia (shown in attached video below), you have the ability to create a user, see all users or get individual user, update a user and delete a user! Users also have the ability to add a list of other users as friends. User can create thoughts, which other users can add reactions to.

## Installation

After you clone my repo, run:

```
npm install && npm run seed && npm run start
```

## Usage

Attach the routes to a front end user interface and you have the basic workings of your very own Social Media Platform (try to use the power wisely!)
